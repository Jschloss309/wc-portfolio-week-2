      <p id="P1Title">You’re probably wondering … So who is the guy behind this?</p>
      </br>
      <p id="P1">His name is Jonathon M. Schloss, student of Wyncode Academy in Fort Lauderdale. Jon is pursuing a longtime passion of his: to become a Full Stack Developer. He loves to create but, more importantly, he loves to learn. On the opposite side of the
        spectrum, when he’s not hacking away at the keyboard creating the next Apple he focuses on soft skills, such as Agile Development and presentations. His interest goes beyond the realm of just coding; he loves the design aspect, as well as the
        interaction between the product and user.</p>

      <p id="P2Title">A little bit more about the Hyper Active Caffeinated Euphoric Millennial Samurai:</br>
        </br>
        <p id="P2">He was a Co-Founder in a company called “Apps4me” back in 2011, the same year he graduated High School. Apps4me was a 3-man-operation, which is why he created another company called 341Corp, Inc. As the Chief of Product Development, Jon had to
          do a lot more than Product Development, such as: Providing custom built iPhone and Android apps to local businesses, Conducting A/B testing of customer applications prior to publishing, Managing customer prospecting and lead capturing, and Executing
          Social Media and PR strategy plans of business. In 2012, Jon sold his interest in the company to a partner and devoted his time to planning and creating other online ventures. Today he works closely with and in-house social media team on social
          media content, which includes: Creating content workflows based on trending topics, Producing video content based on core audience’s requests, and Managing social media profiles including Instagram, Twitter, YouTube.
